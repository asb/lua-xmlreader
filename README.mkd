# lua-xmlreader

Provides the [XmlReader 
API](http://dotgnu.org/pnetlib-doc/System/Xml/XmlReader.html)
to Lua applications using [LibXML2](http://xmlsoft.org).  `XmlReader` is an 
API introduced in C# that is arguably easier to use than SAX.  It provides a 
pull interface where you control the reader, which is a cursor moving along 
the document. Call methods such as `reader:name()` to get information about 
the current node and `reader:read()` to advance to the next.  This has the 
advantage versus a tree model such as DOM that the whole document does not 
need to be loaded into memory at once. The many articles and tutorials 
available online referring to XmlReader/XmlTextReader in C#, Java or other 
languages should all be useful if you want to better understand this method of 
handling XML. `lua-xmlreader` depends on the libxml2 library.

## Example
Below is a fairly simple example demonstrating how you extract information 
from an XML document using an XmlReader. It prints each element along with its 
attributes.

    #! /usr/bin/env lua

    local example_xml = [[
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <library>
      <book id='1'>
        <title>Green Eggs and Ham</title>
        <author>Dr. Seuss</author>
      </book>
      <book id='2'>
        <title>Where the Wild Things Are</title>
        <author>Maurice Sendak</author>
      </book>
    </library>
    ]]

    local xmlreader = require("xmlreader")
    local r = assert(xmlreader.from_string(example_xml))

    while (r:read()) do
      local leadingws = ('    '):rep(r:depth())
      if (r:node_type() == 'element') then
        io.write(('%s%s:'):format(leadingws, r:name()))
        while (r:move_to_next_attribute()) do
          io.write((' %s=%q'):format(r:name(), r:value()))
        end
        io.write('\n')
      end
    end

When executed, this would output:

    library:
        book: id="1"
            title:
            author:
        book: id="2"
            title:
            author:

Description:
  Provides the XmlReader API[1] to Lua applications, using LibXML2[2].  
  XmlReader is an API introduced in C# that is arguably easier to use than 
  SAX. It is a "pull" interface where you control the reader, which is a 
  cursor moving along the document. Call methods such as reader:name() to get
  information about the current node and reader:read() to advance to the next.  
  This has the advantage versus a tree model such as DOM that the whole 
  document does not need to be loaded into memory at once. The many articles 
  and tutorials available online referring to XmlReader/XmlTextReader in C#, 
  Java or other languages should all be useful if you want to better 
  understand this method of handling XML. You will require the libxml2 
  library.
